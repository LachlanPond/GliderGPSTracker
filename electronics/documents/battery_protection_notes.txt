Recommended battery protection circuitry:

- Inline Fuse
- Battery protection IC
- Thermistor for charge controller
- Charge controller should have ability to detect source type and set current limits based on it

Notes:
Select correct chip for battery, 4.1V or 4.2V, VERY IMPORTANT
Make sure to set the CC to 0.5C of the selected battery (or whatever battery manufacturer recommends). Also check that the select IC is capable of this.
